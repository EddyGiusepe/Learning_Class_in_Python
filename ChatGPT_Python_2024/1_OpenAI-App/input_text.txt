Trump's victories in key battleground states such as Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin were pivotal to his electoral success. Notably, he regained these states, often referred to as the "Blue Wall," which had been Democratic strongholds in previous elections. 

This election marked the first time since Grover Cleveland in 1892 that a former president was elected to a non-consecutive second term.
